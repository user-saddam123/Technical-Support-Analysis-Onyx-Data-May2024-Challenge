## Data Preparation and Cleaning Steps
During the project, several data preparation and cleaning steps were performed after loading the dataset into Power BI to ensure accurate analysis. These steps included correcting data types, handling blank values, and creating new columns for more detailed insights:

### 1. Correcting Data Types:
Upon loading the dataset into Power BI, it was observed that many columns had incorrect data types. These were systematically corrected to ensure proper analysis. For example, date and time fields were converted to DateTime data types, numerical fields were corrected to appropriate numerical types, and categorical fields were converted to text.

### 2. Handling Blank Values:
Some columns contained blank values. These blanks were left as they were, either because they were not critical for the analysis or because imputing them might have introduced bias or inaccuracies.

### 3. Creating New Columns:
   * **Time Difference in Minutes:** A new column was created to calculate the time difference in minutes between the ticket creation time and the first response time. This column helps in evaluating the responsiveness of the support team.
   * **Time Difference in Hours:** Another new column was created to calculate the time difference in hours between the ticket creation time and the resolution time. This metric is essential for understanding how long it takes to resolve issues.
   * **Weekday or Weekend:** A column was added to differentiate between weekdays and weekends. Saturdays and Sundays were marked as weekends, while the remaining days were marked as weekdays. This distinction helps in analyzing ticket volume and performance variations across different days of the week.
   * **Working Hours Indicator:** A column named "Working Hours" was created to indicate whether the ticket creation time fell within standard working hours (9 AM to 5 PM). Tickets created between 9 AM and 5 PM were marked as "Working Hours," while those created outside this timeframe were marked as "After Working Hours." This helps in assessing the support team's performance during and outside of regular business hours.

By performing these data preparation and cleaning steps, the dataset was refined to support a more accurate and insightful analysis of the Technical Support Centre's performance.
